How to make a 3D sample of beads for PSF measurements with ~water refractive index (1.33).
- Method adopted from https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/555730v2 (section 3.3):

"We prepared a 1% [w/v] solution of low melting point agarose (A9414, Sigma-Aldrich) in water, heated it up to completely dissolve the agarose, and let it cool down to approx. 40 °C. We then vigorously vortexed the stock solution of TetraSpeck fluorescent beads, and added 2.5 µL to 400 µL of the agarose solution, and vortexed again. We then added a 50 µL drop onto a coverslip. After a few minutes, we mounted the sample in water, and imaged the ~1 mm thick gel that contained immobilized fluorescent beads throughout."

## Materials:
- TetraSpeck™ Microspheres, 0.1 µm, fluorescent blue/green/orange/red (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/T7279).
- UltraPure™ Low Melting Point Agarose (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/16520050).
- Microscope slides (e.g. https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=MS10UW2).
- Small precision glass cover slips #1.5H (170 µm) thickness and ± 5 µm tolerance (e.g. https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=CG15CH2).
- Large precision glass cover slips #1.5H (170 µm) thickness and ± 5 µm tolerance (e.g. https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=CG15KH1).
- Masking tape (or similar).
- Wet lab equipment (precision scales, sonicator, vortexer, microwave, 20/200/1000uL pipettes and tips, various beakers and tubes).

## Method:
- Prepare 1-2 slides by taping small coverslips on each side to make a 'bridge' for a large coverslip (so that a ~170um slab of agarose can be deposited in the middle -> **see photos**).
- Get the beads from the fridge, sonicate and vortex them for a few minutes.
- Put 0.1g of agarose into a glass beaker, add 10mL of pure water and swirl around.
- Microwave the agarose solution in 10s intervals until just boiling, swirl in between intervals and check for clarity (should take ~60s and be fully clear at the end).
- Allow the agarose to cool until still noticeably warm to touch (i.e. above body temperature) and then pipette 400uL into 1.5mL tube. This starts the clock since the agarose will now cool quickly and solidify -> **so be ready!**
- **Immediately** add 2.5uL of beads to the agarose and vortex vigorously (consider 5uL for higher density).
- **Quickly** pipette 50uL of agarose/bead solution into the middle of the pre-prepared slides.
- **Now** squash the agarose/bead droplet with the bridging coverslip and tape down.
- The beads should be good for ~24hours (note that as they dry out the concentration of beads and agarose goes up...).
- 1-4% agarose should have a refractive index in the range 1.335-1.339 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64103-3, figure 3a).

Note: it should be possible to increase the refractive index by using sucrose-water, glucose-water or glycerol-water solutions.
